# Recovering Brainwallet Keys

Along with every secret phrase generated using this software, there are a series of recovery phrases which can be used to recover a secret key.

By default, there are 4 recovery phrases generated with each secret phrase, and 2 of those keys can be used to regenerate the secret phrase. The total amount of phrases cannot be less than the minimum amount to recover the secret.

The amount of phrases generated and the amount of phrases required for recovery can be changed using CLI options during generation.
